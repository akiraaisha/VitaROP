VitaRop
===============================================================================

This git contains compiled rop scripts for launching the PKG Installer &
SignUp Apps for PSVita's on 1.80 & 1.81.

## How do I run this?

Well, first off, you need a PSVita that is on 1.80 or 1.81. Next, you need any
type of local server that can run PHP code. Once you have both of those, simply
place these files on your server and connect your PSVita to it.

## But I have a PSVita that's not on those old crappy firmwares!

Vitasploit can call support_uri's via the WebKit exploits
